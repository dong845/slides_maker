## The fastest way to judge it: download a deck

**[Download the "Lab Meeting / Paper Talk" .pptx](templates/decks/en/transformer-talk/template.pptx?raw=1) and open it in PowerPoint.** It is a 15-slide reading of "Attention Is All You Need": the paper's figures are cropped straight from the PDF, the attention formula is editable native math text, the BLEU comparison is a native chart you can double-click and re-number, every slide carries a full spoken script in its notes, and bullets reveal click by click in presentation mode.

Prefer the browser first? [Flip through all 16 decks online](https://dong845.github.io/slides_maker/). But don't judge an AI slide tool by its marketing screenshots alone: open the file it produces and click around.

## Template Gallery

Eight directions, one set in English and one in Chinese. Each is a complete example deck with real content, not empty placeholders.

## What makes slide-maker different

AI presentation tools roughly fall into four categories. slide-maker only does the last one:

| Category | Output | Editable element by element in PowerPoint? |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| Template fill-in | Content poured into a fixed template | Partially, limited by the template |
| Image-based | One big picture per slide, packed into PPTX | No, each slide is a picture |
| HTML presentation | Slides in a browser | Not a PPTX |
| **Native editable (slide-maker)** | **Real text boxes, shapes, native charts** | **Yes, click anything and edit** |

On top of that, it does four things most tools skip:

- **It reads before it draws.** A paper gets read end to end, a repo starts from its README. Every number and figure is traced back to the source, and you confirm a structure draft before any slide is drawn. It will not paste the abstract onto slide one and call it a day.
- **It gets reviewed before you see it.** After generation, every slide is rendered to an image and handed to an independent critic agent. Cramped layout, weak contrast, numbers that don't match the source: all get sent back for fixes. You receive the deck only after the critic signs off.
- **More than text stays editable.** Data charts are built as native PowerPoint charts you can double-click and re-number. Formulas are editable native math text, not screenshots. Paper figures are cropped from the PDF as-is, never redrawn.
- **Script and motion come included.** Presentation decks carry a full per-slide script in speaker notes, and bullets are native PowerPoint click builds. You can walk on stage with it.

One more thing that matters if you iterate a lot: every deck is generated by a build script that ships next to the file. Change the focus, the slide count, or the template with one sentence, and it regenerates cleanly instead of you reworking slides by hand.

To be plain about it: it does not promise a perfect deck in one shot. It promises to remove the expensive part, reading the material, planning the structure, laying out pages, making figures, writing the script, and to hand you a real file you can keep editing. The polish that remains is yours. That is exactly why the output is native PPTX.

## How it works

1. **It asks first.** Who is the audience, how long is the talk, live or self-read, what style. Short answers are enough. Say "you decide" if you are in a hurry.
2. **It reads the material.** Papers, docs, and repos are read in full. Figures are cropped from the PDF, key numbers are verified line by line, and nothing without a source lands on a slide.
3. **It shows you the plan.** What each slide says, which figure goes where, what gets animated. You confirm before it builds. This is the cheapest moment to change direction.
4. **It generates the PPTX.** Layout is guaranteed by code, with automatic layout checks both at build time and on the rendered output. Overflow, overlap, and font problems get caught there.
5. **An independent critic reviews it.** Rendered slides go to a critic agent that judges them against presentation standards. Fixes land, the deck is re-checked, and only then is it delivered to `~/Downloads/<deck-name>/`.

## Quick start

### Step 1: Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dong845/slides_maker.git
cd slides_maker
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --target both
```

If you only use one tool, replace `both` with `codex` or `claude`. Then go back to the chat and send your request.

### Step 2: Say what you want, in one line

```text
Use slide-maker to create a PPT from paper.pdf.
```

That one line is enough. slide-maker is interview-driven: it does not need a long, perfect prompt, because it asks. A real first exchange looks like this:

```text
You:  Use slide-maker to create a PPT from paper.pdf.

It:   Before I build, four quick things:
      1. Template: one from the gallery, your own reference PPT,
         a clean design by me, or an AI-generated visual identity?
      2. Audience and setting: presented live, screen-shared,
         or sent to be read? How long is the talk?
      3. Source scope: just this PDF, or also code, figures, other docs?
      4. Language and density: English or Chinese? Visual-first or more text?

You:  For my advisor and labmates, 12 minutes, live. Only paper.pdf.
      English, visual and concise. You pick the look.

It:   (after reading the paper) Here is the plan: 15 slides.
      Slide 4 places the paper's Figure 1 whole; the results page
      becomes a native chart you can re-number...
      Confirm the direction and I will build.
```

In Claude Code the questions show up as clickable options; in Codex they arrive as short follow-up text. Either way short answers are enough, "you decide" is always a valid answer, and "show me a few style directions first" gets you rendered style candidates to pick from.

Other ways to open the conversation:

```text
Use slide-maker to create a technical presentation from this repository.
```

```text
I have a reference PPT: /path/ref.pptx. Use its visual style only, not its content,
and make a new English deck from paper.pdf.
```

Put your material in the current project, or give a full path in the request. You can also start with just a topic: it will research the subject online first, then agree on a structure with you.

### Optional: AI image generation

If you want a generated cover, page illustrations, or a full generated visual identity, say "use AI image generation" in the chat. This branch uses Codex image generation and needs an active Codex subscription. Without it, slide-maker still produces fully editable PPTX.

## How to use the templates

The gallery lives in `templates/decks/`, English under `en/`, Chinese under `zh/`. Two ways to use them:

**Option 1: point at it (simplest).** Put the template path in your request:

```text
Use slide-maker. Follow the style of templates/decks/en/nvidia-overview/template.pptx
and build a product intro from my product.md.
```

It parses the template's layout and visual system, then applies them to your content.

**Option 2: register it for repeated use.** Copy a template you like into the local template registry, and slide-maker will list it as an option every time:

```bash
# Claude Code users
cp -r templates/decks/en/nvidia-overview ~/.claude/slide-templates/nvidia-overview

# Codex users
cp -r templates/decks/en/nvidia-overview ~/.codex/slide-templates/nvidia-overview
```

Use `en/` templates for English decks and `zh/` for Chinese ones. The layouts match; only the copy language differs.

## Best-fit scenarios

Research talks are the home turf, because it parses the problem, method, results, figures, tables, and equations in a paper. But whenever material needs to be explained clearly, it can give you a first deck you can present and keep editing.

| What you have | What you can make |
| --- | --- |
| Papers, experiment results, paper figures | Paper reading, lab meeting, proposal, defense, experiment report |
| Code repositories, README files, technical docs | Repo walkthrough, architecture talk, progress update, engineering recap |
| Course material, product docs, market data | Class talk, product introduction, market analysis, proposal |
| Reference PPT | New topic, new content, reorganized story |

## Troubleshooting

If generation or preview rendering fails, run the check for your environment. Most failures are missing Python dependencies or LibreOffice:

```bash
# Codex
python3 ~/.codex/skills/slide-maker/scripts/check_env.py

# Claude Code
python3 ~/.claude/skills/slide-maker/scripts/check_env.py
```

It prints the exact fix for anything missing. If problems persist after installing dependencies, open an issue with the error output.
