## The honest test: open the file, not the screenshot

Any AI slide tool looks great in a screenshot. The real question is what you get *back*. So open one and click around:

- **[Paper / lab-meeting deck ↓](templates/decks/en/transformer-talk/template.pptx?raw=1)**: a 15-slide reading of *Attention Is All You Need*. Double-click the BLEU chart and re-number it; click into the attention formula and edit it like text; open **View ▸ Notes** for the full spoken script; press Play and watch the bullets reveal one click at a time. Every figure is cropped straight from the paper's PDF.
- **[Visual / culture deck ↓](templates/decks/en/chengdu/template.pptx?raw=1)**: the other end of the range, a fully generated visual identity where cover, dividers, and interior read as one system.

Rather browse first? **[Flip through all 16 decks online](https://slides.addsum.top/).** But don't judge an AI slide tool by its gallery. Judge it by the file it hands you: open it, and click anything.

## How to use the templates

The gallery lives in `templates/decks/`, English under `en/`, Chinese under `zh/`. Two ways to use them:

**Option 1: point at it (simplest).** Put the template path in your request:

```text
Use slide-maker. Follow the style of templates/decks/en/nvidia-overview/template.pptx
and build a product intro from my product.md.
```

It parses the template's layout and visual system, then applies them to your content.

**Option 2: register it for repeated use.** Copy a template you like into the local template registry, and slide-maker will list it as an option every time:

```bash
# Claude Code users
cp -r templates/decks/en/nvidia-overview ~/.claude/slide-templates/nvidia-overview

# Codex users
cp -r templates/decks/en/nvidia-overview ~/.codex/slide-templates/nvidia-overview
```

Use `en/` templates for English decks and `zh/` for Chinese ones. The layouts match; only the copy language differs.

## What makes slide-maker different

AI presentation tools roughly fall into four categories. slide-maker only does the last one:

| Category | Output | Editable element by element in PowerPoint? |
| --- | --- | :---: |
| Template fill-in | Content poured into a fixed template | Partially, limited by the template |
| Image-based | One big picture per slide, packed into PPTX | No, each slide is a picture |
| HTML presentation | Slides in a browser | Not a PPTX |
| **Native editable (slide-maker)** | **Real text boxes, shapes, native charts** | **Yes, click anything and edit** |

### A small team of agents: separate jobs, separate incentives

slide-maker isn't one prompt doing everything. It's a set of **specialized agents**, each with a single role, deliberately kept independent so that no one mind both *builds* the deck and *grades* it:

- **Content-planner**: the lead strategist and designer. It does the reading nobody else did and decides what each slide says, which figure or chart goes where, the deck's rhythm, and where animation actually earns its place. Because the whole deck flows through one mind, it holds together as an argument instead of a pile of slides.
- **Critic**: an independent reviewer who did *not* build the deck. It judges the *rendered* slides against the talk's purpose (cramped layout, weak contrast, a number that doesn't match the source) and sends fixes back. Having no stake in the draft is exactly what makes it honest.
- **Arbiter**: for high-stakes decks, a second independent check that confirms a critic's finding is real before anything changes, so the loop fixes true problems, not noise.
- **Asset-prep**: a build-time executor that materializes the plan's assets (figure crops, equation images, diagrams) in parallel once you've approved the plan. It makes zero design decisions, so even large decks build fast.

The split is the point: a constructive planner proposes, independent judges dispose. That's why the deck you receive has already survived a review you never had to run.

On top of that, it does four things most tools skip:

- **It reads before it draws.** A paper gets read end to end, a repo starts from its README, and when you have *no* material it researches the topic online first. Every number and figure is traced back to a source, and you confirm a structure draft before any slide is drawn. It will not paste the abstract onto slide one and call it a day.
- **It gets reviewed before you see it.** After generation, every slide is rendered to an image and handed to the independent critic. Cramped layout, weak contrast, numbers that don't match the source: all get sent back for fixes. You receive the deck only after the critic signs off.
- **More than text stays editable.** Data charts are built as native PowerPoint charts you can double-click and re-number. Formulas are editable native math text, not screenshots. Paper figures are cropped from the PDF as-is, never redrawn.
- **Script and motion come included.** Presentation decks carry a full per-slide script in speaker notes, and bullets are native PowerPoint click builds. You can walk on stage with it.

One more thing that matters if you iterate a lot: every deck is generated by a build script that ships next to the file. Change the focus, the slide count, or the template with one sentence, and it regenerates cleanly instead of you reworking slides by hand.

To be plain about it: it does not promise a perfect deck in one shot. It promises to remove the expensive part (reading the material, planning the structure, laying out pages, making figures, writing the script) and to hand you a real file you can keep editing. The polish that remains is yours. That is exactly why the output is native PPTX.

---

## How it works

1. **It asks first.** Who is the audience, how long is the talk, live or self-read, what style. Short answers are enough. Say "you decide" if you are in a hurry. No material at all? Give it a topic and it will research online before anything else.
2. **It reads (or researches) the material.** Papers, docs, and repos are read in full: figures cropped from the PDF, key numbers verified line by line, nothing without a source on a slide. With only a topic, it researches current information online first, then works from that.
3. **The content-planner shows you the plan.** The planner agent turns its reading into a per-slide plan: what each slide says, which figure goes where, what gets animated, and how the deck flows. You confirm before it builds, which is the cheapest moment to change direction.
4. **It generates the PPTX.** Layout is guaranteed by code, with automatic layout checks both at build time and on the rendered output. Overflow, overlap, and font problems get caught there.
5. **An independent critic reviews it.** Rendered slides go to the critic agent (with an arbiter cross-checking on high-stakes decks), judged against presentation standards. Fixes land, the deck is re-checked, and only then is it delivered to `~/Downloads/<deck-name>/`.
6. **You tune it in plain language.** Not perfect? Just say so in the chat (*"turn slide 7 into a chart," "cut the intro," "warmer palette," "make it 10 slides," "shorten the notes"*) and it rebuilds cleanly from the same script. No dragging boxes by hand; keep refining until it's right.

**What it costs:** the tool is free; you pay only your AI usage. The read-plan-build path is cheap; the independent review loop is the expensive part, and it scales with stakes: a quick internal deck gets a light single-pass check, while a conference-grade deck with a multi-critic panel can consume a few hundred thousand tokens. Say "light review" or "skip the critic" any time to trade polish for cost.

## Quick start

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/quickstart_en.png" alt="Quick start: install once, start /slide-maker, it reads or researches, confirm the plan, build + critic review, get the pptx then tune">
</p>

### Step 1: Install

You need **Python 3.9+**, **LibreOffice** (renders slide previews for the automatic layout checks), and **one SVG rasterizer** for icons (librsvg, cairosvg, or any Chrome-family browser).

| OS | LibreOffice | Icon rasterizer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | `brew install --cask libreoffice` | `brew install librsvg` |
| Linux | `sudo apt install libreoffice` | `sudo apt install librsvg2-bin` |
| Windows | `winget install TheDocumentFoundation.LibreOffice` | Chrome or Edge installed (used headless) |

**Windows note:** the pipeline is cross-platform Python and is exercised in CI on Linux, but day-to-day development happens on macOS. If you hit a Windows-specific issue, `check_env.py` below will name the missing piece; issues with error output are welcome.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/addsumtech/slides_maker.git
cd slides_maker
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 scripts/install_skill.py --target both
```

If you only use one tool, replace `both` with `codex` or `claude`. Not sure what's missing? The [check command](#troubleshooting) prints the exact fix.

**Prefer a one-liner? Install just the skill with [`npx skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)** (no clone, about 1.1 MB):

```bash
npx skills add addsumtech/slides_maker#skill-dist
```

It prompts for the agent and scope. `#skill-dist` is a lightweight, skill-only branch (no gallery or website), so the install stays small and fast. Add `-g` to install globally (all projects), `-a claude-code` (or `-a codex`) to skip the agent prompt, and `-y` for a fully non-interactive run. You still need the runtime dependencies above: LibreOffice, an SVG rasterizer, and `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Step 2: Invoke it and answer the interview (the recommended path)

The best, most reliable result comes from **invoking the skill and answering its short interview step by step**:

```text
/slide-maker
```

The interview opens as a clickable, tabbed form (Topic · Template · Audience · Style): arrow keys to move, Enter to pick, and every question ships with ready-made options. The topic tab even guesses candidates from your recent projects. **Answering each question is what makes the deck *yours* instead of generic**: audience, length, live-vs-self-read, density, language, and look all steer the plan. Short answers are fine, and **"you decide" is always a valid answer**. But letting the skill *ask* beats making it *guess*.

**In a hurry? A one-liner works too, but treat it as a shortcut, not the best path:**

```text
Use slide-maker to create a PPT from paper.pdf.
```

It starts straight from your file and skips the topic question, which is convenient. But every question you *don't* answer becomes an assumption the skill has to make, so you'll usually spend more time tuning afterward. **When the deck matters, answer the interview.** (In Codex there's no slash command; the same questions arrive as plain text. Fully supported, just less clicking. Claude Code is the smoother ride.)

Either way, what follows is a short conversation, not a prompt-writing exercise:

```text
It:   Before I build: which template? Who is the audience, how long,
      live or self-read? Is this PDF the only source?
      English or Chinese, visual-first or balanced?

You:  For my advisor and labmates, 12 minutes, live. Only paper.pdf.
      English, visual and concise. You pick the look.

It:   (after reading the paper) Here is the plan: 15 slides.
      Slide 4 places the paper's Figure 1 whole; the results page
      becomes a native chart you can re-number...
      Confirm the direction and I will build.
```

Two more things worth knowing:

- **"Show me a few style directions first"** gets you rendered style candidates to pick from before the full build.
- Put your material in the current project, or give a full path in the request. **No material at all?** Give it a topic; it researches online first, then agrees on a structure with you.

Other ways to open:

```text
Use slide-maker to create a technical presentation from this repository.
```

```text
I have a reference PPT: /path/ref.pptx. Use its visual style only, not its content,
and make a new English deck from paper.pdf.
```

### Optional: AI image generation

If you want a generated cover, page illustrations, or a full generated visual identity, say "use AI image generation" in the chat. Two ways to power it, either works: a Codex subscription uses its built-in image generation with no key, or set an OpenAI API key to go through the API. With neither, slide-maker still produces fully editable PPTX.

---

## Best-fit scenarios

Research talks are the home turf, because it parses the problem, method, results, figures, tables, and equations in a paper. But whenever material needs to be explained clearly (or when you have only a topic and no material yet), it can give you a first deck you can present and keep editing.

| What you have | What you can make |
| --- | --- |
| Papers, experiment results, paper figures | Lab meeting & paper reading, conference oral talk, poster, proposal, thesis defense, experiment report |
| Code repositories, README files, technical docs | Lab meeting, repo walkthrough, architecture talk, progress update, engineering recap |
| Course material, product docs, market data | Class talk, product introduction, market analysis, proposal |
| Nothing yet, just a topic in your head | Hand it a topic; the agents research current information online, agree on a structure with you, then build the deck from scratch |
| A reference PPT | New topic, new content, reorganized story: its look, your material |

---

## Troubleshooting

If generation or preview rendering fails, run the check for your environment. Most failures are missing Python dependencies or LibreOffice:

```bash
# Codex
python3 ~/.codex/skills/slide-maker/scripts/check_env.py

# Claude Code
python3 ~/.claude/skills/slide-maker/scripts/check_env.py
```

It prints the exact fix for anything missing. If problems persist after installing dependencies, open an issue with the error output.
