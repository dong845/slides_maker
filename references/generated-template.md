# Generate a template with an image tool

The user picked Q1's **"generate a template with an image tool."** Instead of building on a
provided template or designing a clean default, you **create a bespoke visual identity with the
image tool** (a styled hero/divider illustration) and then **reproduce it natively** so every
content block fits it. Use it for a *vivid, designed* deck — a product launch, a festival/event,
a brand or culture deck, a playful pitch — where a clean default look isn't enough.

This branch **decides the look up front**, so after it's confirmed you **skip the 3-direction
gate** and run the rest of the interview (purpose, audience, source, language) normally.

## The construction model (this is the whole idea)
A good generated template is a **cohesive visual SYSTEM**, not one pretty picture — a palette, a
small **motif vocabulary** (the signature shapes/decorations), a type pairing, and **component
treatments** (how a card, a stat, an emphasis band, a title look). It is realised in **two
layers**, and the split is what keeps it editable *and* on-brand:

- **Hero + section-divider slides → a full-bleed GENERATED image.** A rich, styled, **text-free**
  illustration carries the mood; the title and badges sit on top as **native** editable shapes.
  These are the **two "end-page" treatments** that carry the full-strength imagery.
- **Content slides → built NATIVELY to match, on a SHALLOW background — never a flat single
  colour.** The content (cards/chips/bands) is native python-pptx that reuses the template's
  palette, motifs, and component treatments — that's why inserted blocks *fit*. But the slide
  **canvas underneath them is not a plain fill**: every interior page carries a *subtle, low-
  contrast* background so the deck feels designed end-to-end, not "cover is gorgeous, body is
  blank." A flat one-colour content slide next to a lush cover is the #1 tell of a half-finished
  generated template. The shallow background is **faint by design** (it sits *behind* content and
  must never fight the text — see the legibility guardrail), and it comes from one of:
  - a **faint native texture** in the palette — a soft two-stop gradient wash, a faint
    `backdrop_motif` field, or a tinted corner/band — the lightest-weight option, fully editable; **or**
  - a **subtle imagery plate** — a dedicated low-contrast, text-free background image generated in
    the same style (placed `picture(fit="cover")`), or the hero re-placed full-bleed under a heavy
    `scrim_overlay` so only a ghost of it remains.
  Pick whichever suits the style (a geometric style → native motifs; a painterly/photographic style
  → a faint imagery plate), and **apply the SAME treatment on every content slide** so they read as
  one system. Only the cover and dividers get the full, vivid imagery.
  - **Make the content BLOCKS semi-transparent (frosted) when they sit on an imagery/textured plate.**
    A flat *opaque* card on a rich background reads as "pasted on". Give cards/panels a **slight
    transparency** so the plate shows through (~30–45%) and they belong to the scene — a low-alpha glass
    tint of the block colour + a subtle lighter rim (`deckkit.glass_card`, or `box(grad=[(0,tint,α),
    (1,tint,α)])` with α≈0.55–0.72), the **same treatment deck-wide**, with the tint/rim chosen to
    **harmonise with the palette** (dark deck → dark glass + faint accent rim). **Keep text ≥4.5:1** —
    raise α (more opaque) or strengthen the tint over a bright/busy patch. (design-principles.md "Block
    fill must FIT the background".)

> Don't make every slide a generated image with text baked in — baked text isn't editable, wraps
> badly in other languages, and can't be critiqued/fixed. Images set the mood on heroes/dividers;
> native shapes carry the content.

## Workflow

### 1 — Mini-interview for the visual identity (before generating)
Run a short extra interview *now* — only what the *look* needs (purpose/audience/source come
later in the normal interview):
- **Scenario / topic** — what the deck is for (e.g. "summer music festival annual handbook").
- **Offer the style as a choice — list common styles AND an auto option.** Present, as selectable
  options:
  - **The 3–4 best-fit named styles** for this scenario from the **Style library** at the end of this
    file (e.g. **Memphis** from the Sugar Rush sample, or Swiss, Art Deco, Vaporwave, Editorial,
    Risograph, Glassmorphism, Blueprint…). A named style gives the image tool a strong, coherent target
    *and* a ready palette + motif + type starting point for the native `style.py` — so it's the
    recommended path when the user has a leaning.
  - **"Describe your own look"** (a vibe, era, reference in words) and **"I'll provide a reference
    image / brand."**
  - **"Let the image tool pick the style" (auto)** — the user has no preference and wants you to
    choose. Don't generate from a *cold* prompt even here: from the **scenario + brand colours**, YOU
    select the best-fit library style (name it back to the user so the choice is legible — "for a summer
    festival I'll go Memphis/pop"), or, when the scenario is distinctive, let the image tool decide by
    giving it a richer *mood-led* prompt (scenario + energy + palette + "design a cohesive visual
    identity") rather than a named style. Either way the 🔴 sample-slide checkpoint below is where the
    user approves or redirects — so "auto" still gets a real look to react to, never a blind commit.
- **Vibe / mood (if describing your own)** — the aesthetic in words: energy (calm↔loud), era,
  references. Use this to pick/blend a library style or to author a fresh one.
- **Brand colours / must-haves** — any fixed colours, a logo, words that must appear.
- **Reference material — invite drop-ins.** Explicitly offer: *"drop in any reference images, a
  logo, a mood board, screenshots of a look you like, or a brand guide and I'll steer the
  generation by them."* Use provided references to anchor the style (and, if a logo/photo is
  given, place it natively, not regenerated).

**Then TAILOR the chosen style to *this* deck before generating** — fold in the topic, the brand
colours, the energy, and anything from the reference materials. The library entry is the *starting
language, not a straitjacket*: customise its palette/motifs to fit, and blending two presets (or a
preset + a reference) is fine — just name what you're combining so the choice is legible to the user.

### 2 — Generate the template image(s)
Generate a **full-bleed, text-free** hero/divider illustration in the chosen style:
- **Tooling — auto-detect the source, no API key needed** (build the prompt with
  `scripts/image_prompts.py`; full guidance in `references/image-generation.md`). Use what's present,
  in order: **(1)** native imagegen when the host has it (inside Codex — use the agent tool call
  directly, free, no key); **(2)** else
  the **Codex CLI** `scripts/generate_images_codex.py --orientation landscape` if `codex` is installed
  (Codex/ChatGPT subscription, **no key** — shells `codex exec`, decodes the hosted image from the
  session rollout); **(3)** else, only as a fallback, the OpenAI API `scripts/generate_images_openai.py`
  with `OPENAI_API_KEY`. **Don't prompt the user to choose or ask for a key when (1) or (2) is
  available — just use it and say which; ask only if none exists.** Render at the deck's
  aspect (16:9 → e.g. `1536x864` / `2048x1152`). In Codex's native path, follow its save-path policy:
  generate first, then move/copy the selected output from `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images/...` into
  this deck's folder before referencing it in `style.py` or a build script.
- **Prompt craft:** describe the *style + motif vocabulary + palette*, the subject/scene, **"no
  text, no lettering, no logos"**, and **leave a calm, lower-contrast zone** (a corner/band)
  where the title will sit. Ask for the **signature motifs** explicitly (e.g. "scattered Memphis
  geometric shapes — zigzags, dots, triangles, squiggles, checkerboard — bold black outlines")
  so you can reproduce them natively later.
- Generate **1–2 plates**: a **hero** (cover) and, if the look differs, a **divider** variant.
- **For the content-slide shallow background, decide native vs. a third plate:** if the look is
  geometric/graphic, the subtle background is best done **natively** (faint gradient + sprinkled
  motifs) and needs no image. If the look is painterly, photographic, or texture-rich, generate
  **one extra low-contrast background plate** — a **text-free, faint, evenly-toned** version of the
  style (calm, low-saturation, no strong focal point) made to sit *behind* content. Prompt it
  explicitly for low contrast and even tone ("soft, faded, low-contrast background texture, lots of
  calm negative space, no focal subject") so text stays readable on top without a heavy scrim.
- Keep assets in `~/Downloads/<deck>/assets/generated/`. Never leave a generated template
  image referenced only from Codex's default generated-images cache or an OS temp folder.

### 3 — Derive a matching `style.py` (treat the image as a style example)
Study the generated image the way you'd study a provided style example
(`references/style-analysis.md`) and encode it so native content matches:
- **Palette — extract it from the image** so colours are coherent:
  resolve the image path relative to the deck/build script, then call
  `BASE = deckkit.palette_from_image(ROOT / "assets/generated/hero.png", 6)`; set the style's
  base/ink and `ACCENTS` from it. (This is the bridge that makes native blocks fit the
  generated look.) Avoid bare `"assets/..."` paths that depend on the shell's current directory.
- **Motif vocabulary** — write 3–5 tiny native helpers for the signature shapes (e.g.
  `zigzag()`, `dot()`, `triangle()`, `squiggle()`), drawn with `deckkit` autoshapes in the
  palette, with the same outline weight. **Sprinkle them sparingly** as accents near content —
  never over the text.
- **Component treatments** — define the template's card / stat / emphasis-band / chip /
  title-chrome look as helpers (e.g. a rounded card with a **colour-header band**, a dark
  **emphasis band** with an accent headline, an accent-bar **title chrome**). Content slides call
  these so every block is on-system.
- **A `content_bg(slide)` helper — the shallow interior background, called FIRST on every content
  slide.** This is what stops content pages being flat. Encode the chosen treatment once so it's
  identical everywhere: e.g. a faint two-stop gradient (`deckkit.scrim_overlay` over the base, or a
  gradient fill), a faint `deckkit.backdrop_motif(... color=<very light palette tint>)`, or a
  `deckkit.picture(bg_plate, fit="cover")` followed by a strong `scrim_overlay` to mute it. Keep it
  *low-contrast by construction* and verify body text still clears 4.5:1 on top.
- **A `brand(slide)` helper for the logo (only if the deck is about a company/institution/product).**
  Wrap `deckkit.logo(slide, LOGO_PATH, corner=..., h=...)` so the real logo lands in the SAME spot
  on every slide. Decide the corner once to fit the template (top-right is the usual choice; move it
  if the title chrome or motifs occupy that corner) and keep it consistent. On a vivid hero, add a
  small scrim/light plate behind the logo so it stays legible.
- **Type + chrome** — pick a display font that fits the vibe (portable; see `font-guidance.md`)
  and set `deckkit.FONT`/`EAFONT`; define `title_bar`/`footer` to the template's chrome.
- Put all of this in the deck's `style.py` (copy `references/examples/style_example.py` as the
  starting shape).

### 4 — Render a sample and get feedback (hard gate)
Build **two** slides — the **cover** (hero image + native title/badges) and **one real content
slide** (native, using the derived components: a few cards + an emphasis band + motifs) — render
them, and show both. The content slide is essential: it proves the blocks actually fit.
> **🔴 CHECKPOINT** — show the generated template (hero + a sample content slide) and get the
> user's OK. Iterate on their feedback until they confirm. Only then proceed.

**Match the FIX to what they asked to change — don't reflexively recolor:**
- **A small palette / contrast tweak** ("warmer accent", "lighter background", "less saturated", "bigger
  title zone") → adjust `style.py` (and re-place natively); **no regeneration needed**.
- **A change of ATMOSPHERE / mood / style / feel** ("make it more energetic / calmer / darker / more
  futuristic / more organic / more playful / more premium / more clinical") → **RE-GENERATE the hero —
  do not just change the colour.** A mood lives in the **imagery itself** — its *subject, composition,
  lighting, texture, and motifs* — not only the palette. Rewrite the image prompt so **all** of those
  shift to embody the new atmosphere (e.g. *more energetic* → dynamic diagonal composition, bold forms,
  vivid directional light; *calmer* → sparse, soft, generous negative space; *more organic* → natural
  materials and hand-made texture instead of hard geometry), generate a fresh plate, then **re-derive
  `style.py` from the new image** so the native blocks match. Recoloring the old plate leaves its
  original mood baked into the picture, and the hero then fights the feeling the user asked for. If it's
  unclear whether they mean a tweak or a new atmosphere, ask in one line before spending a generation.

### 5 — Continue the interview, then build to the template
- The look is decided → **skip the 3-direction gate** and any style question; run the rest of the
  normal interview (purpose & audience & time, source material, language).
- **Build (step 4 of SKILL.md):**
  - **Cover + section dividers** → the generated image full-bleed (`picture(..., fit="cover")`),
    with the **title and badges native on top**, placed in the image's calm zone (add a soft
    scrim/plate behind the title if the area under it is busy, so contrast stays ≥ 4.5:1).
  - **Content slides** → built **natively** in `style.py`, in this order: **(1)** `content_bg(slide)`
    first so the page has its shallow background (never a flat single colour); **(2)** the template's
    cards/bands/chips/motifs for the content; **(3)** `brand(slide)` last (if it's a
    company/institution/product deck) so the logo sits on top of everything. Reuse the source's real
    figures/tables as always — framed to sit on the template (a thin card/plate behind a figure helps
    it sit on a textured background).
  - **The logo also goes on the cover and dividers** (placed natively over the imagery, with a scrim
    if needed) so the brand is present on every page, including the end pages.
  - Keep the craft rules (one idea/slide, whole figures, contrast, suitable spacing, balanced
    blocks). Then the normal **render + critic loop** — the critic judges whether content
    genuinely fits the template (palette, motifs, components consistent), whether **every interior
    page carries the shallow background** (none left flat), whether the **logo is present and
    consistently placed** where the deck calls for one, and that everything stays legible.
- **Save the confirmed template to the registry** (`~/.codex/slide-templates/<name>/` in
  Codex, or `~/.claude/slide-templates/<name>/` in Claude Code): the `style.py`, the
  generated `assets/`, and a `profile.md` — so it's a reusable choice next time (it shows up
  under Q1's registered templates).

## Legibility & fidelity guardrails (busy styles fight text)
- **Text-free images, native text on top** — never bake slide copy, numbers, labels, or logos
  into the generated plate (the deck's standing rule). *One narrow, opt-in exception:* a purely
  **decorative hero WORDMARK** baked into the cover image **only if the user explicitly asks** for
  that exact stylised-lettering look — and even then, every other piece of text stays native.
- **Contrast on a busy background** — a vivid hero will wreck a thin title. Put the title in the
  image's **calm zone**, or behind a **solid / translucent plate** (a rounded box in a palette
  colour), and check `contrast_ratio ≥ 4.5`.
- **Don't let motifs crowd content** — decorations are *accents in the margins/corners*, not a
  layer over the words. If a motif overlaps text, move or drop it.
- **Consistency across slides** — same palette, same motif set, same component treatments, the
  **same shallow background**, and the **same logo placement** on every slide. A one-off card style,
  a stray colour, a flat content page among textured ones, or a logo that jumps corners breaks the
  "template" illusion faster than anything; the critic should flag it.
- **The shallow background must stay BEHIND the content** — it's atmosphere, not a competing layer.
  If it darkens or busies the area under text, mute it harder (lighter tint, stronger scrim, fewer
  motifs); body text must clear 4.5:1 against whatever the background leaves under it. A subtle
  background that forces every text block onto its own opaque card has been made too strong.
- **Logo = the REAL mark, present where it belongs** — for a company/institution/product deck the
  logo appears on every page; use the real asset (image-generation.md's hierarchy), never a faked or
  recolored one, and if it's missing, ask the user or use an honest "logo here" placeholder.
- **Generated real things must be right** — if the hero depicts real objects/places, the
  size/proportion/count/colour must be factually correct (the image-generation fidelity rule).

## Style library — well-known starting styles (seed, then tailor)
Proven visual languages to seed the generation from — pick the **3–4 best-fit for the scenario**,
offer them as options (+ "describe your own" / "I'll provide a reference"), then **tailor** the
pick (palette, energy, brand colours) before generating. Each entry gives the *palette* /
*motifs* / *type* you'll both put in the image prompt **and** encode in the native `style.py`
(so content matches). Blend two when it fits; add new ones as you discover them.

  geometric. *Palette:* hot-pink · cyan · yellow · green · black on cream. *Motifs:* squiggles,
  zigzags, confetti dots, triangles, checkerboard, bold black outlines. *Type:* chunky rounded
  display + clean sans. Heroes are busy illustrations; content = cream bg + colour-header cards +
  sprinkled motifs.

  white. *Motifs:* big type, bold shapes, hero numbers, subtle gradient. *Type:* strong geometric sans.

> These are *starting points*, not a closed list. The user's own reference, brand, or a described
