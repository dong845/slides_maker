# Image Generation for Slide Visuals

Use generated images as optional visual plates, not as the source of truth. The deck's
claims, labels, tables, charts, equations, and important annotations still belong in
editable PowerPoint objects or faithful source figures.

## Decide by taste and purpose — not by a rule or a quota
Whether a slide gets a generated image is a **design call**, the same way motion is. Reach
for a plate where your design sense says it will **emphasize** a point, make a slide **more
engaging**, or help **guide** the audience — and skip it where it wouldn't. There is **no
count to hit in either direction**: it's fine for two or several *consecutive* slides to
carry a plate when the design wants that, and fine for a long stretch (or a whole deck) to
have none. Don't think "most slides need zero" or "spread them out" — think about what
*this* slide and the deck's story need.

The failure to avoid is **thoughtless** use, not frequency:
- a plate dropped in for flourish, to fill space, or that competes with the slide's content;
- a generated image standing in where evidence belongs — a source figure, a real
  computed/extracted artifact, a chart, a screenshot, a logo. Those stay real and traceable.

When the user asks to use a GPT/image tool, this still applies: generate where your taste
says it helps, by design sense — and **propose plates for the user to opt into** rather than
generating on every slide by reflex. Decide image-by-image, the same way you decide
build-by-build.

## When to use image generation

Use the agent's native image generation skill when a slide would benefit from:

- a text-free hero image, atmospheric background, or side-panel photo/illustration;
- a conceptual scene where no source figure exists and exact factual detail is not the point;
- decorative texture, motif, object detail, or transition imagery that supports the deck's style;
- product/lifestyle/editorial imagery when the user is asking for a pitch or narrative deck and no real product asset is required.

Prefer real or deterministic assets instead when the visual carries evidence:

- source figures, tables, screenshots, charts, medical/scientific imagery, microscopy, maps, UI states, code, product shots, logos, or brand marks;
- any result whose content must be traceable to the user's material;
- any plot or diagram that needs readable labels, axes, numbers, or formulas.

## Planning workflow

1. During Step 3, decide each slide's visual role: source figure, deterministic chart,
   native diagram, generated plate, or no image — **by taste and purpose** (see the section
   above). Note which slides your design sense calls for a plate, so the manifest covers
   exactly those.
2. For generated plates, write the intended frame before prompting: full-bleed background,
   side panel, crop strip, texture block, or isolated object.
3. Build the prompt manifest from a sub-outline of **only the plate-worthy slides**, not the
   whole deck. Write a tiny `image-slides.md` with one heading per slide you decided needs a
   plate (or reuse just those headings), then run:

   ```bash
   python scripts/image_prompts.py image-slides.md ~/Downloads/<deck>/assets/generated \
     --deck-size 16:9 \
     --style "<deck art direction>" \
     --calm-zone "left third / right third / top band / none"
   ```

   **Do NOT pass `--count <deck-slide-count>`.** Feeding the full deck length would emit a
   context-free plate for every slide regardless of whether the design wants one — thoughtless,
   padded imagery. The script no longer pads to a count; it emits one prompt per heading in
   your sub-outline. (`--count` remains only as an optional *cap* that truncates the list.)
4. Feed each prompt from `image_prompt_manifest.json` or `image_prompts.md` to the
   agent's image generation skill/tool.
5. Save the selected outputs to the manifest filenames in the deck folder. **Note the
   manifest numbers files `slide-01.png`, `slide-02.png`… over your *sub-outline*, not by
   real deck position** — so map each generated file back to the actual deck slide it was
   planned for when you place it (e.g. the second plated slide is `slide-02.png` even if it's
   deck slide 7).
6. Place the image with `deckkit.picture(...)`:

   ```python
   import deckkit as dk

   dk.picture(
       slide,
       "assets/generated/slide-03.png",
       0.0, 0.0, 10.0, 5.625,
       fit="cover",
       alt="",  # decorative plate
   )
   ```

**Choosing `fit` — never crop the subject out.** `fit="cover"` fills the frame by cropping
the overflow; `fit="contain"` shows the whole image, letterboxed. The deciding question is
whether the image has a **subject the slide depends on**:
- **`fit="contain"`** whenever the subject — or all its parts — must stay fully visible: a
  rocket that should read as a whole rocket, a scene of several objects (e.g. Earth + Moon +
  Mars that must each show completely), a figure or screenshot whose edges matter. `cover`
  would slice the subject (a rocket reduced to its tail, planets shown as slivers).
- **`fit="cover"`** only for edge-tolerant **texture, atmosphere, or backgrounds** where any
  crop is fine and there's no single subject to lose.
- If `contain` letterboxes too much, **shrink/zoom the placement or regenerate the plate at
  the frame's aspect ratio** — do NOT switch to `cover` and crop the subject away.

**Generate to fit the placement.** When a plate goes in a specific frame, either generate it
at that frame's aspect ratio, or prompt for the subject **centred with generous margin** so a
`cover` crop (or any reframing) can't cut it. For a full-bleed `cover` plate, require the
subject to sit well inside the central safe area, away from the edges.

**Always re-view after placing.** Look at the rendered slide and confirm the key subject is
whole and uncropped — for *every* `picture()`, generated or source. A cropped-out subject is
the most common generated-image failure; the static render is where you catch it.

## OpenAI API fallback

In Codex, prefer the native imagegen tool when available. Outside Codex, users can
generate the same manifest through the OpenAI Images API:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

python scripts/generate_images_openai.py \
  ~/Downloads/<deck>/assets/generated/image_prompt_manifest.json \
  --model gpt-image-2 \
  --size 2048x1152 \
  --quality medium
```

The script saves each output to the manifest path, such as `slide-01.png`. By default it
skips existing files; pass `--overwrite` to regenerate. Use `--dry-run` to preview what
would be generated without calling the API.

Do not paste API keys into prompts, slide text, source files, or manifests. Keep the key in
the environment (`OPENAI_API_KEY`) or the user's normal secret manager.

## Prompt rules

Generated slide plates should be text-free:

- no readable words, letters, numbers, formulas, labels, logos, watermarks, citations, or fake UI copy;
- leave low-detail calm space where editable slide text will sit;
- ask for composition explicitly, e.g. "visual weight on the right, calm space on the left";
- carry a consistent palette, density, medium, and motif across the few plated slides;
- generate the first plate as the style-setter, then reuse its palette and treatment for the
  other plated slides (often just one or two) so they read as one family.

For generated images that suggest a technical domain, keep them illustrative. If the
slide needs actual evidence, compute or extract the real artifact instead.

## Verification

After placing generated assets:

- render the deck and check that the image does not compete with slide text;
- confirm no accidental readable text, pseudo-labels, fake logos, or fake charts appear;
- **confirm the key subject is whole, not cropped** — the main object/scene must be fully
  visible, not sliced by the frame (the #1 generated-image failure); switch `cover`→`contain`
  or shrink/regenerate if it's cut;
- make sure every informative image has alt text, and decorative plates use `alt=""`;
- keep final selected assets in the deck folder so the build script is reproducible.

Do not leave a build script pointing to an image in an agent's temporary or generated-images
cache. Copy the selected asset into the deck folder first.
