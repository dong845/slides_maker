# Orchestration — parallel section fan-out for large decks

**Default: don't.** For a normal deck (~6–14 slides) a *single* author writing one
build script is both faster and higher-quality — the cost is thinking and reviewing,
not writing the file, and one author keeps the palette, grid, chrome, narrative arc,
and one-message thread coherent for free. Reach for fan-out only when it actually
pays:
- **Large decks (~15+ slides)**, where authoring the slides genuinely dominates time.
- **Independently-sourced sections** (different papers / datasets / product areas)
  that can be researched and drafted in parallel.

When you do fan out, the rule that protects quality is: **centralize coherence, fan
out only the independent work.** One coordinator owns the comprehension brief, the
plan/arc, and a single shared style module; sections (not single slides) are authored
in parallel against that style; then everything is assembled into one deck and judged
by an independent critic panel.

> Why sections, not one-agent-per-slide-with-neighbor-chat: a `.pptx` is a single
> file (no clean slide-copy API — per-slide merging is fragile), and a deck's quality
> lives in *cross-slide* consistency and arc. N independent slide-agents drift and
> fight the artifact; the wins (understanding, the critic rounds) don't parallelize
> per-slide anyway. Sections + a shared style module capture the real parallelism
> without the drift. "Neighbor awareness" is a *global* property — the coordinator
> supplies each section the context of its neighbors; it is not pairwise gossip.

## Actor side — coordinator + parallel section authors

1. **Coordinator does the non-parallelizable core itself (one owner):** the comprehension
   brief and plan/arc are the **content-planner's** job (`agents/content-planner.md`,
   SKILL.md Step 1). On a large deck the coordinator *is* that single planner mind (or
   dispatches it once); like the planner it may fan out *reading* across the independent
   sources, but it must never split the brief or arc across the section subagents — that one
   owner is what keeps the deck coherent.
   - the **comprehension brief** (step 1) — one mind holds the through-line,
   - the **plan/arc** (step 3) — write each slide's takeaway, then **group slides into
     contiguous sections** and assign each section its **role** and its **page range**
     (`START_PAGE`),
   - **`style.py`** — the single source of truth for palette, `FONT`, title/footer
     chrome, and layout constants (copy `references/examples/style_example.py`, tune to
     purpose via `design-by-purpose.md`). Sections never redefine colours or chrome.

2. **Fan out one subagent per section, in parallel** using the host runtime's available
   multi-agent/subagent tool (in Codex, discover multi-agent tools with `tool_search` if
   they are not already exposed). Give each subagent: the comprehension
   brief, the full plan, **`style.py`**, **its** section's role + slide takeaways +
   `START_PAGE`, and a one-line summary of the **neighbouring** sections (so seams and
   transitions are clean). Each subagent:
   - writes `section_NN_<name>.py` exposing `build_section(prs)` that imports `style`
     and appends its slides (copy `references/examples/section_example.py`),
   - **self-renders just its section** with `assemble.preview_section(...)` →
     `render_deck.sh`, looks at the PNGs, and optimizes (same style/base as the final
     deck, so preview == final),
   - returns the finalized module path.
   Parallelize **asset prep** the same way (figure crops, equation PNGs, native
   diagrams) — these are independent and a real time win.

3. **Assemble into one deck** (`scripts/assemble.py`):
   ```python
   from assemble import build_deck
   build_deck("~/Downloads/<deck>/<deck>.pptx",
              ["section_01_intro.py", "section_02_method.py", ...],  # plan order
              template="<brand.pptx>")   # or omit for a blank styled deck
   ```
   One base deck, every `build_section` run in order — one file, no XML merge, no drift.

## Critic side — independent panel + routing (the "second orchestrator")

Render the **assembled** deck, then run the critic as a panel (this is the high-stakes
pattern from step 5, made explicit):
- Dispatch the dimension critics **in parallel** — content/fidelity, design/layout,
  back-of-room audience (`agents/critic.md` + `review-rubrics.md`). For very large
  decks, optionally add **per-section critics** plus **one whole-deck critic** whose
  only job is **coherence, arc, and seams** between sections.
- The coordinator **merges and de-dups** their findings, then — before routing — runs
  the **arbiter pass** over the candidate findings in parallel (like the panel;
  `agents/arbiter.md` + the promote/discard rule in `review-rubrics.md`), and **routes
  only the *promoted* findings** to the section subagent that owns that slide (or fixes
  them in the module), re-assembles, re-renders, and re-critiques. So a section author
  never burns a round on a false-positive, and a cross-section coherence finding is
  validated before it forces a re-assemble. Stop at consent / round cap (step 5).
  *Scaling:* on a very large deck the per-section + whole-deck critics already
  double-cover, so the arbitration can **fold into the whole-deck critic's pass** rather
  than spawning separate arbiters; arbiter **job 2** (fix-verification) re-checks the
  promoted findings on the re-assembled deck, focused on the touched sections + their
  seams.

This *is* the "two orchestrators communicating" idea — realized the way the harness
actually supports it: a round-based **actor-coordinator ↔ critic-panel** loop with
finding-routing, **not** a persistent peer mesh. Keep the critic **independent** — it
judges the assembled pixels, it does not co-design — because that independence is what
makes its verdict worth anything.

## Checklist / gotchas
- Sections **import** `style`; they never redefine palette, font, or chrome.
- The coordinator assigns `START_PAGE` per section so page numbers stay continuous.
- Assembly order = plan order; the arc is the coordinator's responsibility.
- Animations (`anim.py`) are added **inside** a section's `build_section`, per slide.
- Output still lands in `~/Downloads/<deck>/` (the normal rule); the assembled `.pptx`
  is the deliverable, with a `render/` of the final PNGs.
- If the deck is small, skip all of this — one build script is the right tool.
